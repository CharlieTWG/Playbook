# Introduction

At TWG, Exploratory Research is core to our product development process. We use it to hone in on an area of interest and develop a contextual understanding for the people, situations and environments we are designing for. Exploratory research helps us answer such questions as: "what are the meaningful characteristics of an ideal mentoring app?"

### What is Exploratory Research?

Exploratory research is the systematic investigation of peopleâ€™s realities, needs and behaviours with the purpose of defining a problem space, establishing product priorities and improving the final product design. Exploratory research activities include interviews, diary studies and _in situ_ observation. 

### Exploratory Interviews

Exploratory interviews are one-on-one discussions whose formats range from semi-structured to unstructured. Like any research activity, interviews have their pros and cons, but when used appropriately interviews can generate transformational insights for your product. In this Playbook, we'll show you how to plan, conduct and successfully use exploratory interviews. By the end of this Playbook, your team will be able to confidently conduct interviews and use them to build better products. Ready? Let's get started...
