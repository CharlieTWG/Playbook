# Research limitations: Time

Time is a precious resource in research and in business. When financial runway is limited, there are often pressures from stakeholders to move from research into design and production as quickly as possible. At the same time, when researchers sacrifice rigour in favour of time savings, the impact of research diminishes. 

This especially the case for exploratory research, where the process is meant to produce deep insights. Rushed research during the exploratory phase could lead to cherry-picking of biased findings that could lead the product down the wrong path. While some research is always better than no research, we don't have to shortchange the research process.

So how can we conduct impactful research when time is limited? We'll talk about some considerations and tools for researchers when pressed for time:

### Risk Management

Research is like the almighty Elasticgirl from the Incredibles films - it can take up as much or as little time as we give it. The question is in the amount of **risk** and **confidence** involved. When there are risky assumptions, such as during the exploratory phase of a new product, it would benefit the organization to spend more time on research. Similarly, when the product impacts millions of users and a high level of confidence is needed in the answers, we should take the time to do in-depth research.

As researchers, we can have the conversation with stakeholders about the level of risk involved and confidence needed with the research project. Make a recommendation on how long we would need for the current phase of work, what the time would be used for, and why it's important. If there is pushback, outline the risk/confidence tradeoffs that would be made and the implications. That way, you and the stakeholders can agree on a timeline that makes sense for everyone.

### Prioritize & Scope







Being confronted with tight timelines and still expected to have a rigorous process.  
Conducting impactful research in a short amount of time?

Rushed analysis gives you just the headlines of the story  
Compromises rigour  
Increases the risks that you will feel pressured into cherry picking data, gleaning just the surface  
Exploratory research is meant to produce deep insights. If you don't go deep, you're doing yourself and your team a disservice.

You don't need to default to skinny or thin research methods \(guerilla, I'm looking at you\) 

### Prioritize & Scope

A well-scoped research plan - You can't answer every research question or explore every thread. 

Stick to your key goals as you develop your plans. Be honest and realistic with your PM about

Decks!!

Automation  
time-stamping notes  
transcription of audio  
  
mindful of your time:Some things take time \(recruitment!\) Make your discussion guides as you recruit, build your final decks with placeholders until you have the data to put in them, 

### Post-Testing Debrief 

lead the process, own the discussion

### Involve stakeholders 

1. Having people in the room during research
2. Note-taking 
3. Analysis together 
4. Topline results 

Rapid Synthesis

-Stay organized : allow yourself time after sessions to document key quotes, findings and key themes. So much harder after 8 sessions to go back to participant 1 and pull out some meaning. 

  
Debrief sessions 

Leverage your team for analysis sessions   
-Good note-taking -&gt; 

Are afraid to be straight up with their PMs for fear that the research could be cut altogether.   
Research is not a luxury 

Producing value   
Make your work visible - screener questionnaires, discussion guides, etc. All the work that goes into your process should be talked about at stand up meetings. 

Rushing research vs. doing no research at all

Presenting results

Key findings &gt; Detailed report   
Don't spend time on decks - 

### Conclusion

There will be things that you can't control. Recruitment always takes the longest. If you can quickly come to consensus on scope, strategy and
