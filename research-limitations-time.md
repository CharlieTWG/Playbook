# Research limitations: Time

Time is a precious resource in research and in business. When financial runway is limited, there are often pressures from stakeholders to move from research into design and production as quickly as possible. At the same time, when researchers sacrifice rigour in favour of time savings, the impact of research diminishes. 

This especially the case for exploratory research, where the process is meant to produce deep insights. Rushed research during the exploratory phase could lead to cherry-picking of biased findings that could lead the product down the wrong path. While some research is always better than no research, we don't have to shortchange the research process.

So how can we conduct impactful research when time is limited? We can use effective levers in scope-planning, parallel operations and group context-building. Let's talk about these considerations and tools for researchers when pressed for time.

### Risk Management

Research is like the almighty Elasticgirl from the Incredibles films - it can take up as much or as little time as we give it. The question is in the amount of **risk** and **confidence** involved. When there are risky assumptions, such as during the exploratory phase of a new product, it would benefit the organization to spend more time on research. Similarly, when the product impacts millions of users and requires a high level of confidence in the answers, we should take the time to do in-depth research.

As researchers, we can have the conversation with stakeholders about the level of risk involved and confidence needed in the project. Make a recommendation on how long we would need for the current phase of work, what the time would be used for, and why it's important. If there is pushback, outline the risk/confidence tradeoffs that would be made and the implications. That way, you and the stakeholders can agree on a timeline that makes sense for everyone.

### Prioritize & Scope

Once the timeline has been agreed upon, the researcher can figure out a well-scoped plan. This is the time to be focused and practical. Be focused on the goals and key questions you want to answer through this round of research, and practical about the areas you will be able to cover within the time frame. You won't be able to answer every research question or explore every branch of the topic. Ruthlessly prioritize the most important, impactful, high-risk questions and topics. If need be, have an honest and realistic conversation with your Product Manager \(PM\) about what you're prioritizing and why. After all, PMs live and breathe ruthless prioritization and can become our best advocates.

### Parallel Processes

Components of research work can happen in parallel without interference. For example, recruitment typically takes a few days, so you can jumpstart recruitment first, then draft your Discussion Guide as you source participants. If interview schedules are tight, try splitting the interviews with another member of the team, such that you and him/her can run parallel sessions. Synthesis also takes time, but the final presentation can be built out with placeholder information until the sense-making is complete.

### Leveraging the Team

One of the most impactful ways to save time is to get participation from team members involved in your project. This cannot be emphasized enough. Collaboration in the research process helps to generate better research insights, more ideas, and in a shorter amount of time. 

Think of it this way: research can take extra time due to process constraints and context-building. Process constraints refer to output dependencies before moving to the next stage, whereas context-building refers to uploading insights and learnings to all members of the project team. By leveraging the team, we can effectively cut down on time spent for each. Team members can help us run parts of the research in parallel and cut down on time dependencies \(e.g. note-taking during interviews\). They would also not need extra time to build context based on the learnings, as they have been involved in research from the get-go. 

Get your team members involved in as many parts of research as possible. For example, have them listen in on the interviews and take notes, talk through the insights with them after each interview, do group-analysis during data synthesis, and have them craft the sharing of the results. By participating in research, your team will feel more bought into research and help you produce higher quality results more quickly.

### Templates, templates, templates!

There are repeatable and replicable outputs of the research process that can be templated and automated with tools. These include:

* Forms \(e.g. Non-Disclosure Agreements, consent forms\)
* Guides \(e.g. Discussion Guide, Stakeholder Interview Guide\)
* Decks \(e.g. Persona slides, User Journey slides, Recommendation slides\)

![Example templates for TWG&apos;s research team](.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2018-09-13-at-10.23.26-am%20%281%29.png)

By templating the common outputs of research, the team can save time and also standardize the research practice across members. These outputs can be organized in shared organizational folders, divided by stage of research \(i.e. Planning, Sharing\). For forms such as NDAs, you can also upload the templates to tools such as [Docusign](https://www.docusign.ca/) and [Hellosign](https://www.hellosign.com/) to save time when sending them to participants. 

Here are a few templates help you jumpstart the process:

### Just-In-Time Debrief + Summaries

Once research interviews kick off, it could feel like a mad dash to the finish line. Where possible, build 10 minutes between interviews. That allows you to talk through the top-line insights with your team members that sat through the interview, and record summaries of insights in your notes. This process could take at least twice as long if you leave it until all the interviews are done. Save time now by doing the debriefing and summaries regularly.

### Transcription of Notes

Although we advocate for having a note-taker with you during all research interviews, we know that that isn't always possible. Without a note-taker, the most tedious part of the research process is the transcription process. Thankfully, there are tools out there to help you save time. Notably:

* [Zoom.us](https://zoom.us/) provides auto-transcription of each recording, with time stamps. The accuracy is about 50-70%, depending on how clearly the voices were recorded. You can search for keywords in the transcripts, and click into a line of transcription to see/hear the corresponding parts of the recording.
* [Sonix.ai](https://sonix.ai/) also provides auto-transcription, with a few additional features. You can edit the transcript directly in their word editor, and export audio/video clips corresponding to the pieces of text of interest. Their accuracy is also at 50-70%.
* Human transcriptionists provide the most accurate transcription, but at a higher cost and time dependency. If quick turn-around is needed, look for transcriptionists based overseas so they benefit from the time difference. Transcriptionists can be found via platforms such as [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/).

### Group Sense-Making

Once interviews are complete, the laborious step of synthesis and sense-making begins. As with all other parts of research, it is best done in collaboration. If your project team has been involved in the research process thus far \(e.g. listening in on the interviews, debriefing after interviews\), you would be able to jump into group sense-making without additional context- and knowledge-transfer. If your project team has been sporadically or not at all involved in the research, you would need to give them the notes to review before proceeding.

As the researcher, you will be leading the group synthesis and sense-making sessions to provide focus and guidance. Book off the appropriate time slots for synthesis - we aim for 1.5-2 hours for every 5 hours of interview data to synthesize. 

Ahead of the synthesis meetings, do some prep work. Verify the frameworks you'll be using \(e.g. Journey Mapping, Jobs-To-Be-Done\). Then draft up, either digitally or physically, the skeleton canvas on which the group will be visualizing their findings. Think through the methods you'll want to use, such as popcorn synthesis or affinity mapping, and plan out the time required for each section. 

During group synthesis, if you have a large data set, you can divide up the data by participants or by parts of experience. If your data set is small, you can have all team members looking over the same data, to allow for diversity of interpretations. Provide all the materials you'll need \(e.g. stickies, whiteboards, notes\), facilitate the session and keep an eye on the time!

### Sharing of Findings

Unless you work for a large organization with hundreds of eyes on the research results, **don't** write a report. Reports take time to write and read, and as a result, no one likes to read them. Information gets lost in pages and pages of text, making it hard for you to socialize the findings.

Focus instead on key insights and findings. Share them via presentations, \(shorter\) emails, demos, and/or company messaging channels. Gather them in a central platform \(using the [Nuggets Framework](https://medium.com/@tsharon/the-atomic-unit-of-a-research-insight-7bf13ec8fabe)\). Here are more examples of [Nuggets](https://blog.airtable.com/how-to-build-a-ux-research-system-that-runs-on-autopilot/) in [action](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rTQN81GOhjBh1eyxfVZ7StTXMD_1gq7BitTLF9mo0Mk/edit?usp=sharing).

### Conclusion

Research doesn't need to take 7 years and a Ph.D. to generate. You can do lean-and-rigorous research by defining clear scope, running parallel processes with help from the project team, and building contextualized insights collaboratively.
