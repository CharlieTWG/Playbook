# Listening

> If what one has to say is not better than silence, then one should keep silent. --Confucius

If your objective is to learn from other people, it stands to reason that you should be spending the overwhelming majority of your interview listening. The math is pretty straightforward, the more speaking you do the less they’ll do of it. This may sound simple but it’s difficult to pull off in practice. Listen back to your interviews and you’ll quickly realize you're a lot chattier than you remember. This is normal, we’re socially trained to fill awkward silences. In fact, for most people, silence in social settings can be a source of anxiety.

### Tips

1. You can fight your instinct to interject by [deliberately practicing](https://jamesclear.com/deliberate-practice-theory) the act of letting people complete their thoughts. When they are done speaking, count "one Mississippi, two Mississippi” before following up. You might also benefit from incorporating reminders to “let them do the talking” into your discussion guide. 
2. Occasionally, interviewees might ask you questions like: “Does that make sense?”, "I don't really know if I answered your questions?" or "Is that what you're looking for?" Don’t take the bait. You aren’t there to have a dialogue, you are there to listen. Reassure them that there are no wrong answers, keep probing with open ended questions and more importantly keep listening. 
3. Silence is powerful but it can also be used against you. Some interviewees will be less forthcoming and provide you with very few details. One way to address this is to mirror their responses. That is to repeat back the critical one to three words in their answers.   **Example**  `Interviewer: Tell me about your experience using the app. Respondent: It was fine. Interviewer: Fine?`   Your counterpart will elaborate on what was said and sustain the process of connecting.
